   ```
   VITE_POCKETBASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8090
   ```

2. **Switch to Real API**
   In `src/lib/api.ts`, change:
   ```typescript
   // From:
   export { mockApi as api } from './mockApi'
   
   // To:
   export { api } from './pocketbaseApi'
   ```

3. **Restart Your Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Step 5: Test the Application

1. **Create an Account**
   - Go to your React app
   - Sign up with a new account
   - The account will be created in PocketBase

2. **Add Companies**
   - Use the "Add Company" button in the sidebar
   - Track companies you're interested in

3. **View Jobs**
   - Jobs from tracked companies will appear on the dashboard
   - You can apply filters and search

4. **Track Applications**
   - Click on job cards to update application status
   - Track your progress through the hiring pipeline

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Connection Refused**
   - Make sure PocketBase is running on port 8090
   - Check that no firewall is blocking the port

2. **CORS Errors**
   - PocketBase handles CORS automatically for localhost
   - Make sure you're accessing from `http://localhost:5173`

3. **Collection Not Found**
   - Verify all collections are created with correct names
   - Check that field types match the schema

4. **Authentication Issues**
   - Make sure the users collection extends the auth collection
   - Verify email/password requirements are met

### Useful PocketBase Commands:

```bash
# Start with custom port
./pocketbase serve --http=127.0.0.1:8090

# Start with custom data directory
./pocketbase serve --dir=/path/to/data

# Enable debug mode
./pocketbase serve --debug
```

1. **PocketBase Cloud** - Official hosted solution
2. **Self-hosted** - Deploy on your own server
3. **Docker** - Use the official PocketBase Docker image
